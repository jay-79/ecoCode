Taking into account when the device is entering or exiting the power save mode is higly desirable for the battery life.

It implies the existence of a broadcast receiver registered on the action `ACTION_POWER_SAVE_MODE_CHANGED`, or programmaticaly with a call to `PowerManager#isPowerSaveMode().`

## Compliant Code Example

```java
new IntentFilter(Intent.ACTION_POWER_SAVE_MODE_CHANGED)
```

Or

```java
intentFilter.addAction(ACTION_POWER_SAVE_MODE_CHANGED)
```

Or

```java
IntentFilter.create(ACTION_POWER_SAVE_MODE_CHANGED,"")
```

Or

```java
powerManager.isPowerSaveMode()
```
