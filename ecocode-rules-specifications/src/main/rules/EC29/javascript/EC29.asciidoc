This rule aims to limit the usage of all types of CSS animations which can be very costly in terms of CPU and memory.
They must only be used when they are indispensable and should be limited to the CSS properties `opacity` and `transform` with it's associated functions : `translate`, `rotate` and `scale`.
You can also inform the navigator of upcoming changes with the `will-change` instruction for more optimization.
